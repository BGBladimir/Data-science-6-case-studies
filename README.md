In the following tasks I apply data science techniques to the following 6 departments: 

#### Table of Contents
1. Human Resources Department: I develop an artificial intelligence model to reduce employee hiring and training costs by predicting which employees may leave the company in the future.
2. Marketing Department: I optimize the marketing strategy by performing customer segmentation.
3. Sales Department: I develop time series forecasting models to predict future product prices.
4. Operations Department: I develop a Deep Learning model to automate and optimize disease detection processes in a hospital (as should have been done during the COVID-19 pandemic).
